Switch Brainstorming

Immediate concern #1: Edit drawCard so that when choosing stack, the AI determines the hand within the powerCard function, and not before it's called. It creates an error otherwise if the hand size of the player who used the powerCard doesn't match the size of the hand of the player who they're using it on

So we got an easy and a hard; easy is completely probability-based, weighted towards more bad decisions than good (maybe 40-60?), and hard is the "objective" right move given the information the player has known to them

Now we move onto the harder one â€” I was thinking we could just change the above AI function into easyAI, and make the new one hardAI, and then to make a "medium" version of the AI, have a mediumAI that does a 50-50 between easy/hard to make its moves, while the hardAI makes the absolute best moves possible (or maybe like 70-30, I guess)

For that, you'd need to check what cards are known and not known constantly, keep in mind which players have which cards if they swap with the stack or use the Jack, be ready to eliminate the cards as necessary, and so on, you'll probably think of all of them once you actually start to do it
